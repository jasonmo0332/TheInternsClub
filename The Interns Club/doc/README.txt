				The Interns Club
The objective of our project was to create an easy to use interface for college students to find internships. Employers would post these internships, and professors would be able to recommend their students.

You can view live updates of jobs as soon as an employer posts them. Students can also view any notifications regarding whether or not they got accepted or rejected from a job and whether their professor recommended them. The employers can view students who have applied along with their resumes and recommendation letters if any and can accept or reject an applicant. Professors can recommend students and post letters of recommendation which can be viewed on the employer side. All the student, professor, and employer profiles are editable and can be edited any time and would be saved in our database. Students can not apply to a job unless they have a resume. If a student does not have a resume he/she can upload one on his/her page and can then apply for a job.
